/**
 * The prop-firm bot as a team of specialists.
 *
 * One generalist prompt answered pricing, drawdown, payouts and login trouble
 * the same way, so its answers were as vague as its brief. Here a router
 * (`routeSubAgent`) reads each visitor message and hands it to one specialist:
 * each has its own brief (what to lead with, what to ask, when a person must
 * take over), the articles of its topic placed first, and the workspace's own
 * extra instructions for it (Settings → AI bot → Sub-agents).
 *
 * Every specialist still reads the whole help centre: a question that mixes
 * topics ("what does the 25k cost and what is its drawdown?") or a router that
 * guessed wrong still gets a correct answer. The router is rules only (no
 * model call, so no extra wait), and a follow-up with no topic of its own
 * ("aur 25k pe?") stays with the specialist of the previous messages.
 *
 * This file has no server imports: the settings page shows the same
 * definitions and runs the same router in its "Test the router" box.
