 * doubt: a low retrieval score, a figure it could not trace, a complaint word,
 * anything that looks like "my account". On a prop firm's chat that meant most
 * real questions got "I couldn't find the exact answer… our team will reply in
 * 10-15 minutes", because traders write "dd kitna hai 10k pe" and the article
 * is called "Maximum Loss Rules".
 *
 * Here the model reads the whole published help centre (loadFullKnowledge),
 * is told how a good agent works (understand the question, combine rules,
 * answer, ask one clarifying question when it really is unclear), and decides
 * itself when a person is needed, saying so with [HANDOVER: reason]. What
 * still protects the visitor: figures must be in the help centre or the
 * conversation (unsupportedFigures, checked by the caller), the model is told
 * it cannot see accounts, and a request for a person still goes straight to
 * the team before this runs.
 *
 * This file is pure (prompt and parsing) so it can be tested without a model.

    '3. Answer it yourself. You are expected to resolve almost every question on your own. Lead with the direct answer, then the one or two details that matter (conditions, exceptions, the next step). If they asked several things, answer each.',
    '4. Genuinely unclear (which account, which phase, which plan changes the answer)? Ask ONE short, specific question instead of guessing or handing over. If you can, give the answer for the common cases in the same reply.',
    '5. If the HELP CENTER does not say something, say so plainly and give the closest thing it does say. Do not invent it and do not hand over just because one detail is missing.',
    '6. You cannot see the customer\'s account, dashboard, trades, payments or documents. Still help: explain the rule that applies, what usually causes their situation, and what they can check themselves.
