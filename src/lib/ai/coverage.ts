/**
 * Which specialist is missing knowledge: a checklist per sub-agent, checked
 * against the indexed help centre (Settings → AI bot → Knowledge sources).
 *
 * Each model specialist (sub-agents.ts) needs a few facts to answer most of
 * what traders ask it: Payouts needs the payout schedule, the profit split,
 * the minimum, the methods, the processing time and how to request one.
 * Every item is searched in the workspace's published articles and Bot
 * knowledge with the same keyword index the bot uses (retrieval.ts), in a
 * few wordings; it counts as covered when one wording finds an article the
 * bot's own confidence gate would answer from. The rest is listed as
 * missing, so a team knows which article to write before re-indexing.
 *
 * A keyword check by design: free, instant, and it needs no embeddings, so
 * it works on a help centre that has never been indexed. An article worded
 * very differently from every probe can show as missing; adding the term
 * the probe uses (a heading is enough) fixes it, and also helps the bot.
 * No server imports: the report is built from an index the caller loads.
